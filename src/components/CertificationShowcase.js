            <h3>My AWS Learning Path</h3>
            <p>
              My cloud journey began with Stephane Maarek's comprehensive AWS courses, which provided 
              both theoretical knowledge and guided hands-on practice. While these courses were instrumental 
              in helping me pass the certification exams, I've found that additional self-directed projects 
              have been essential for deepening my practical understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in continuous learning and applying knowledge through real-world projects. 
              This website itself represents one of my hands-on learning experiences in web development 
              and cloud deployment.
            </p>

              <div>
                <strong>Learning Tip:</strong> While certification courses are valuable, I recommend supplementing 
                them with additional hands-on practice to truly master cloud concepts and services.
