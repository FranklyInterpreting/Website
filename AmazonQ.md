### 3. Styling
- Migrated CSS to component-specific stylesheets
- Maintained the original design and responsive behavior
- Ensured Bootstrap integration

### 4. Asset Management
- Moved images and other static assets to the public directory
- Updated references to use the correct paths in React

## Benefits of the React Migration
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Component reusability
- More efficient updates and changes
- Better state management
- Enhanced performance through virtual DOM

## Next Steps
